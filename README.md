# Twitter-Bot
This is a bot for Twitter that I created which likes and retweets content posted by other creators on the subjects of ReactJS and JavaScript

This bot was created using python and Tweepy to access the Twitter API.
There are different ways of creating bots for Twitter and for this bot I decided to use Tweepy.Cursor() with a query to search for the posts of interest however I will create bots with alternate processes to decide which is best.
